I am currently an AI Research Resident at [FSoft AI Center](https://fpt-aicenter.com/), working closely with [Dr. Quang Pham](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WC7Bu_kAAAAJ&hl=en). My research interests are in the field of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) and Large Language Models (LLMs).

In 2023, I graduated with a bachelorâ€™s degree in Control and Automation Engineering from [VNU - Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology](https://hcmut.edu.vn/en). During my time there, I was a research student at the VAS Laboratory, advised by [Dr. Giap Hoang Nguyen](http://dca.dee.hcmut.edu.vn/professors-page/nguyen-hoang-giap/).
