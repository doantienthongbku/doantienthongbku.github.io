In the past few years, high-resolution videos and images have become popular for display on edge devices such as mobile phones. While recent studies of super-resolution problems require a huge resource for inference, this brings a great challenge for super-resolution networks to achieve better inference time on commercial GPUs. This paper presents a fast and lightweight super-resolution network that can leverage the power of Dynamic Convolution. We further adopt many efficient network designs such as pixel-unshuffle, high frequent block, repeat upscaling, and methods to increase the model's capacity like spatial attention module. On average, our model is more than 10 times smaller than most current models in efficient super-resolution problem. Overall, our technique achieves a comparable performance with contemporary state-of-the-art methods with much fewer parameters.
